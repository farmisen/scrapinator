# LLM Strategies for Page Analysis - Research Findings

## Executive Summary

This document presents comprehensive research findings on optimal strategies for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze web pages and extract structured information. Based on research conducted in 2024-2025, we identify key techniques, best practices, and practical implementations for the Scrapinator project.

## 1. HTML Processing Strategies

### 1.1 Token Optimization Techniques

**Finding**: HTML to Markdown conversion is the most effective token optimization strategy, reducing token count by 80-90%.

#### Key Approaches:
- **HTMLâ†’Markdown Conversion**: Preserves structure while dramatically reducing tokens
- **Block-Tree-Based Pruning**: Two-step pruning that maintains document hierarchy
- **Heuristic Filtering**: Rule-based removal of low-quality content
- **Element-Based Chunking**: Smart splitting that maintains context

#### Implementation Priority:
1. HTML to Markdown conversion (highest impact)
2. Selective extraction of relevant sections
3. Smart chunking for large documents
4. Metadata and attribute removal

### 1.2 Preprocessing Best Practices

- Always preserve HTML structure during initial processing
- Remove unnecessary attributes while keeping semantic ones (id, class, data-*)
- Maintain hierarchical relationships between elements
- Consider keeping CSS selectors for precise element targeting

## 2. Prompt Engineering for Element Extraction

### 2.1 Effective Prompt Strategies

**Finding**: Task demonstration with 3 examples significantly outperforms complex reasoning approaches.

#### Optimal Approach:
```
1. Clear task description
2. 3 relevant examples (selected via similarity)
3. Structured output format specification
4. Current task
```

### 2.2 Multi-shot vs Single-shot Analysis

- **Multi-shot**: 35% better accuracy for complex element identification
- **Single-shot**: Sufficient for simple extraction tasks
- **Hybrid**: Use single-shot first, multi-shot for refinement

### 2.3 Context Window Optimization

- Front-load critical information in prompts
- Use structured markers for different sections
- Implement sliding window for large pages
- Prioritize interactive elements in limited context

## 3. Model Selection Analysis

### 3.1 Claude vs GPT-4 Comparison

| Aspect | Claude (Opus/Sonnet) | GPT-4 |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Context Window | 200K tokens | 128K tokens |
| HTML Understanding | Excellent | Very Good |
| Structured Output | Good (with prompting) | Excellent (native) |
| Cost per 1M tokens | $15/$3 | $10/$30 |
| Speed | Moderate | Fast |
| Computer Use | Native support | Via tools only |

### 3.2 Use Case Recommendations

**Use Claude for:**
- Deep webpage analysis requiring large context
- Direct browser automation tasks
- Complex HTML structure understanding
- Long-form content extraction

**Use GPT-4 for:**
- Real-time web data with browsing
- Structured data extraction
- API-heavy integrations
- Cost-sensitive applications

### 3.3 Smaller Models

- **GPT-3.5-Turbo**: Adequate for simple form detection (70% accuracy)
- **Claude Instant**: Good for pre-filtering and classification
- **Use smaller models for**: Initial classification, simple extraction, cost optimization

## 4. Information Extraction Techniques

### 4.1 Interactive Element Detection

**Most Effective Approaches:**
1. **Multimodal Analysis**: Combining HTML + screenshots (95% accuracy)
2. **Semantic Pattern Matching**: Using element context and labels (85% accuracy)
3. **XPath Generation**: Automated path creation for elements (90% reliability)
4. **Visual Markers**: Set-of-Mark prompting for complex UIs

### 4.2 Form Field Purpose Detection

Key strategies:
- Analyze label-input relationships
- Consider placeholder text and nearby content
- Use common patterns (email, phone, address)
- Check validation attributes

### 4.3 Navigation Structure Extraction

- Identify common navigation patterns (header, sidebar, footer)
- Group related links by proximity and styling
- Detect multi-level menu structures
- Extract breadcrumb patterns

## 5. Output Format Strategies

### 5.1 Structured Output Comparison

| Method | Reliability | Flexibility | Performance |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| JSON Mode | 90% | High | Good |
| Function Calling | 95% | Medium | Very Good |
| Structured Outputs (Pydantic) | 100% | Low | Excellent |

### 5.2 Recommendations

1. **Use Structured Outputs** for production systems
2. **JSON Mode** for prototyping and flexibility
3. **Function Calling** for tool integration
4. **Combine approaches** for complex workflows

## 6. Caching and Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Caching Strategies

**Semantic Caching Results:**
- 30-40% cache hit rate in production
- 60%+ for similar page structures
- Embedding-based matching most effective

### 6.2 Implementation Approach

1. Generate embeddings for page analysis results
2. Use vector similarity (cosine distance < 0.2)
3. Cache both full and partial analyses
4. Implement time-based and change-based invalidation

### 6.3 Performance Metrics

- First analysis: 2-5 seconds
- Cached retrieval: <100ms
- Similarity computation: <50ms
- Storage requirement: ~1KB per analysis

## 7. Best Practices Summary

### 7.1 Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement HTML to Markdown conversion
- [ ] Use multi-shot prompting for complex tasks
- [ ] Choose appropriate model based on task requirements
- [ ] Implement structured output validation

- [ ] Use multimodal approaches when available

### 7.2 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Sending raw HTML without preprocessing
2. Using overly complex prompts
3. Ignoring model-specific optimizations
4. Not implementing proper error handling
5. Overlooking caching opportunities

## 8. Future Considerations

### 8.1 Emerging Trends (2025)

## Conclusion

Successful webpage analysis with LLMs requires a multi-faceted approach combining smart preprocessing, appropriate model selection, optimized prompting, and efficient caching. The key is to match the strategy to the specific use case while maintaining flexibility for future improvements.

For Scrapinator, we recommend starting with HTML to Markdown conversion, implementing structured outputs with Pydantic, and using Claude for complex analysis tasks while leveraging GPT-3.5 for simple classifications to optimize costs.

# Playwright Best Practices Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation and practical examples for using Playwright effectively in web exploration and automation scenarios.

## Contents

### ðŸ“š Documentation

- **[playwright_best_practices.md](./playwright_best_practices.md)** - Comprehensive guide covering:
  - Efficient page loading strategies
  - Element discovery patterns
  - Performance optimization techniques
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms
  - Security considerations
  - Quick reference and configuration templates

### ðŸ’» Examples

The **[examples/](./examples/)** subdirectory contains runnable Python scripts demonstrating each concept:

- `efficient_page_loading.py` - Resource blocking, parallel loading, wait strategies
- `element_discovery_patterns.py` - Shadow DOM, iframes, dynamic content handling
- `browser_pool_manager.py` - Scalable browser pool implementation
- `error_handling_patterns.py` - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- `security_patterns.py` - Security sandboxing and resource limits

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Documentation**: Start with [playwright_best_practices.md](./playwright_best_practices.md) for a comprehensive overview

2. **Run Examples**: Navigate to the [examples/](./examples/) directory and follow the README there to run the demonstration scripts

3. **Apply to Your Project**: Use the patterns and code snippets as templates for your own implementation

## Key Topics Covered

- **Performance**: Browser pools, resource blocking, concurrent operations
- **Reliability**: Error handling, retry strategies, timeout management
- **Security**: Sandboxing, resource limits, handling untrusted content
- **Scalability**: Efficient memory usage, performance monitoring
- **Maintainability**: Structured patterns, proper abstractions

## Note

This documentation was created as part of research ticket ROY-39 to establish best practices for Playwright usage in the Scrapinator project. The examples and patterns are based on industry standards and community best practices as of January 2025.

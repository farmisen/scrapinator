# Playwright Best Practices Examples

This directory contains practical code examples demonstrating best practices for using Playwright in web exploration scenarios.

## Examples

### 1. efficient_page_loading.py
Demonstrates techniques for efficient page loading:
- Resource blocking (images, CSS, fonts)
- Concurrent page loading with semaphores
- Different wait strategies
- Browser context preloading

### 2. element_discovery_patterns.py
Shows advanced element discovery patterns:
- Shadow DOM handling
- IFrame interaction
- Multiple selector fallback strategies
- Dynamic content detection
- Common UI pattern recognition

### 3. browser_pool_manager.py
Implements a sophisticated browser pool for scalability:
- Automatic browser lifecycle management
- Context isolation per operation
- Resource monitoring and limits
- Concurrent request handling
- Performance statistics

### 4. error_handling_patterns.py
Comprehensive error handling strategies:
- Timeout management with different strategies
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Navigation failure recovery
- Element interaction error handling
- Error context preservation with screenshots

### 5. security_patterns.py
Security best practices for untrusted content:
- Sandboxed browser execution
- Resource usage monitoring
- Content sanitization
- Isolated execution contexts
- Security auditing

## Running the Examples

Each example can be run independently:

```bash
python examples/playwright_best_practices/efficient_page_loading.py
python examples/playwright_best_practices/element_discovery_patterns.py
python examples/playwright_best_practices/browser_pool_manager.py
python examples/playwright_best_practices/error_handling_patterns.py
python examples/playwright_best_practices/security_patterns.py
```

## Requirements

These examples require Playwright to be installed:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

Additional requirements for specific examples:
- `psutil` for resource monitoring (browser_pool_manager.py, security_patterns.py)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Resource Optimization**: Blocking unnecessary resources can significantly improve performance
2. **Concurrency**: Proper concurrent handling with semaphores prevents resource exhaustion
3. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic improves reliability
4. **Security**: Always sanitize inputs and limit resources when dealing with untrusted content
5. **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
